# Analytics Projects using Python

this is a place where I keep my data analytics projects documented. They are currently mostly coding practices done at my leisure time to familiarize myself with different Python data analytics and visualization packages.

Most of the code were documented using Jupyter Notebook to display the plots and model results. More detailed breakdown of the projects can be found in the notebooks of each of these projets.


## Flight Analytics

This project explored the different causes to a delay in flights using the Plotly library. Additionally, it showcases the use of LightGBM in a classification problem and attempts to explain the results using SHAP values.

## Store Items Demand Forecasts

This project details the use of ARIMA to conduct time-series prediction on a set of retail items. Plotly was used again to generate interactive visualization.

## eCommerce Retail Data Analysis

Similar to the above analysis, the dataset used in this project was transactional data on an eCommerce site. This analysis, however, focused on customer-level data analytics. Topics explored here include: customer lifetime value, purchase timing prediciton, and multiclass prediciton using XGBoost.

## Company Earnings Prediction

Unlike the previous projects, this project was completed as part of my Masters degree in data analytics. The code uses data from WRDS database to predict earnings using a number of different earnings prediction models. The original goal was to attempt to reproduce some of the finidngs in academic literature (more details found in the code itself). This project, however, also enabled me to have the opportunity to write a wide variety of functions to make the analysis project smoother.
