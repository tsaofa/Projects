# Projects

this is a place where I keep my data analytics projects documented. They are currently mostly coding practices done at my leisure time to familiarize myself with different Python data analytics and visualization packages.

## Flight Analytics

This project explored the different causes to a delay in flights using the Plotly library. Additionally, it showcases the use of LightGBM in a classification problem and attempts to explain the results using SHAP values.
